# randomnumbergame

This program was created in the context of the AI seminar at the University of Duisburg Essen. 
The program is a random number game, where the user has to guess a number generated by the program, which is between 1 and 100. 
To use the program, the following elements must be imported: random, time and Beep from winsound.
First the user is asked to enter the name. Then the program welcomes the user to the game.
After that the user gets asked for a number and gets the information that the game ends with the input of the number 0.
The program checks if the input was a number and if not, the user gets a hint to enter a number. 
After entering the number the user gets the information if the number was too high or too low and gets aksed again. 
The program ends if the user enters 0 or guessed the right number. In both cases a sound is emitted.  
If the user guessed the rigth number he gets the information about the right number, the count of the guesses and how long it took the user to guess the rigth number.
